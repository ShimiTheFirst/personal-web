# MARTINSTEPANEK.DEV

Welcome to the source code of my personal site. It’s currently very WIP (as is this README) but It’s evolving every day.

If you are here to look at my code style, I will soon prepare a better example (with more complexity and some state management) but for now, the static website has to do. I hope you can still get some idea of how I write and structure the code and components.
